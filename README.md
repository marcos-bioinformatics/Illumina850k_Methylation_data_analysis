Illumina850k EPIC Methylation Data analysis

Script for Methylation data analysis and visualization. This is part of the project that I'm working on Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid. We are conducting a clinical study with epilepsy patients which will be published soon.

Here is the script which can be used to perform methylation data analysis:

  - Data normalization
  - Probe filtering
  - Probe-wise differential methylation analysis (DMPs)
  - Differential methylation analysis of regions (DMRs)
  - Blood cell count estimation
  - Data visualization

Data from the study will be available when published.
